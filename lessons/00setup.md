Account
=======

The first step is to make yourself an account on the computer you're
using. Remember the name of this computer so you can find it at the
beginning of class each week. The name is on a label on the bottom of
your computer.

To create your account, log in to the administrator account `missionbit`
with the password `missionbit`. Then open up `System Preferences`, click on
`Users & Groups`, and click the lock to make changes. You'll have to enter
the administrator password here, and then you can click the `+` icon to make
yourself a user. Change the account type from 'Standard' to 'Administrator'
on the first dropdown and fill in the rest of the account information.

Once that's done, click the Apple menu and log out, then login with
your account!

Text Editor
===========

The next most important thing is a text editor. For writing code you want to
use a special text editor designed for that purpose. We have experience with
a lot of these. The trouble is that many of them are either tricky to learn
or expensive to purchase. For this course we're going to be using
[Adobe Brackets](http://brackets.io/), which is super powerful, easy to use, and also free and open
source.

GitHub
======

Most of you should already have a GitHub account but if you don't, go to
[https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and sign up. Make sure you verify
your email address otherwise you won't be able to access all of GitHub's features.

Once your account is set up, download the [GitHub app](http://mac.github.com/)
and log in with your account.
