Deploy an app to Heroku
=======================

Heroku is a service which hosts your applications and integrates nicely with git.
Today we're going to deploy your first application on Heroku!

First you'll want to create an account on Heroku: https://signup.heroku.com/login

Now on GitHub, fork the https://github.com/dgouldin/django-playground repo to your
account. When this completes, you can click the `Deploy to Heroku` button and
follow 

TODO: write the rest of this
install brew
brew install git

sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

make a heroku account
brew install heroku-toolbelt
heroku update
